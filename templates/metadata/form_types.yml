    ## First-time configuration

    *NOTE:* Ignore this section on your first tile deployment. Leave vault token as 'TODO'.

    ## Second-time configuration

    After you have deployed Dingo Secrets once, you can then initialize your Vault.

    Get the `<vault-ip>` from the "Status" tab above.

    ```
    export VAULT_ADDR=http://<vault-ip>:8200
    vault init
    vault unseal
    vault unseal
    vault unseal
    ```

    The output will include:

    ```
    Initial Root Token: 60488d11-5b5b-69ae-42a3-2cc90773fe10
    ```

    Provide Dingo Secrets tile with the Root Token, "Save", and then "Apply Changes" on the OpsManager dashboard.
